# Markdoc

Markdoc is a lightweight Markdown-based wiki system. It’s been designed to allow
you to create and manage wikis as quickly and easily as possible.


## What is it good for?

Potential use cases for Markdoc include, but aren’t limited to:

*   **Technical Documentation/Manuals**  
    Markdoc can be used to write and render hand-written guides and manuals for
    software. Such documentation will normally be separate from
    automatically-generated API documentation, and might give a higher-level
    view than API docs alone. It might be used for client documentation for
    web/desktop applications, or even developer documentation for frameworks.

*   **Internal Project Wikis**  
    Markdoc wikis consist of a single plain-text file per page. By combining a
    wiki with a DVCS (such as [Mercurial][] or [Git][]), you can collaborate
    with several other people. Use the DVCS to track, share and merge changes
    with one another, and view the wiki’s history.

  [Git]: http://git-scm.com/

*   **Static Site Generation**  
    Markdoc converts wikis into raw HTML files and media. This allows you to
    manage a blog, personal website or a collection of pages in a Markdoc wiki,
    perhaps with custom CSS styles, and publish the rendered HTML to a website.
    Markdoc need not be installed on the hosting site, since the resultant HTML
    is completely independent.


## Cool Features

*   Set up [Google Analytics][] tracking in one line of configuration.

*   [Barebones][] wikis that just look like directories with Markdown-formatted
    text files in them.

*   A built-in HTTP server and WSGI application to serve up a compiled wiki with
    a single command.

*   Continuous builds (via `rsync`) mean the server can keep running whilst
    Markdoc re-compiles the wiki. Just refresh your browser to see the changes.

*   Add [Pygments][]-powered syntax highlighting to your Markdoc wiki with a
    single [configuration parameter][syntax-highlighting].

*   Markdoc is [public domain software][licensing]. It will always be completely
    free to use, and you can redistribute it (in part or in whole) under any
    circumstances (open-source, proprietary or otherwise) with no attribution or
    encumberances.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

The minimum requirements to run the Markdoc utility are:

  * Python 2.4 or later (2.5+ highly recommended)

I believe I've gotten Markdoc working fine on Windows systems (at least under the MinGW installed with Git), and
I rewrote the `rsync` dependency in Python so that is no longer a stumbling block for Windows users or distros without it.


### Installation

    $ easy_install Markdoc  # OR
    $ pip install Markdoc


### Making a Wiki

    markdoc init my-wiki
    cd my-wiki/
    vim wiki/somefile.md
    # ... write some documentation ...
    markdoc build
    markdoc serve
    # .. open http://localhost:8008/ in a browser ...
